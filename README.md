# Application Layer Protocol Simulation (DNS, HTTP, FTP, DHCP)

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation and analysis of four core application-layer protocols within a simulated enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer.

The goal was to configure services and analyze packet encapsulation across layers.

## Protocols Implemented
- DNS – Domain name resolution (UDP)
- HTTP – Web communication (TCP)
- FTP – File transfer protocol (TCP)
- DHCP – Dynamic IP address assignment (UDP)

## Key Concepts Demonstrated
- Application-layer service configuration
- TCP vs UDP transport differences
- Packet encapsulation across OSI layers
- Request/response protocol behavior
- Dynamic IP allocation via DHCP

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network topology design
- Service configuration
- Transport-layer analysis
- Troubleshooting and validation testing
